# Development
Aurora uses cmake to build, test, and manage dependencies. To get started, run `cmake .` in the root directory of the project.

## Generating Documentation
Aurora uses Doxygen to generate documentation. To generate documentation, you must have Doxygen installed. Then run `make doc`. Documentation will be generated in the `/docs` directory.
